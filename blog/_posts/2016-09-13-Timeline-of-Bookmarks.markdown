[Activity Stream](http://bit.ly/FxAcSt) for Firefox is a collection of all the things you do in the browser that you care about and is displayed in a rich and meaningful way in a single page. It shows rich content with images from recent pages, screenshots, downloads, closing sessions, notifications, and improve your results in the awesome bar. Eventually it hope to be the central feed of the things every user care about. This is currently available with the [Test Pilot](http://bit.ly/TNFxTp) Addon. You can [enable]({{site.url}}/blog/Installing-Activity-Stream) it, after installing the test pilot add-on. The remarkable features of the [Activity Stream](http://bit.ly/FxAcSt) are visual redesign of Bookmark's page, your top Visited websites, trending stories from Pocket in Highlights section and playing videos from Youtube. This blog speaks on the characteristics of the bookmark page.
 
Searching is the source of exploring, but searching a topic in web sometimes ends in finding many new things. Remembering all those pages is really difficult. So a common technique used by everyone is bookmark. But when the count of pages we marked exceeds a certain level, finding the relevant page in the bookmark search becomes a task. Testpilot Activity stream is with a solution now. We have a *timeline for bookmarks* that list the bookmarks made by the user in a well organised way . This helps us to traverse through the list we stored if we know the time we saved it.

Like the above screenshot the web pages marked by the users are grouped together as today, yesterday, last week, last month and so on towards the past. This helps us to find the pages which we have marked in very early days.
