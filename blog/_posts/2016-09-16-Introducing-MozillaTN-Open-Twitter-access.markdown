Recently, Mozilla introduced Open Mic where communities can be given access to Instagram handle to post more updates about events. It is really one of the inspiring move which is loved by contributors who maintain communities social Media accounts. Recently for Mozilla India meetup, we got opportunity to post directly from mozillagram. [MozillaTN](http://mozillatn.github.io) community would like to follow similar Openness, as it motivate more contributors who actively bring rich knowledge and passion to promote Open Web.

To get started, MozillaTN social Media team came forward to share twitter handle ([@MozillaTN](https://twitter.com/mozillatn)) to the amazing contributors who showed interest to contribute and their leadership skills in the community. The main aim is to bring more quality physical events and encourage those awesome leaders, who conduct big events in their cities.

On sept 17 we have Software Freedom day which is a worldwide celebration of Free software. Almost all Mozilla Communities participate in this event, to promote  Open source contribution, Firefox and other Mozilla products & Vision. On this day two of our young contributors [Paarttipaabhalaji](https://twitter.com/paarilovely) and [Prashanth P](https://twitter.com/prasanthp96) are conducting big events in their college to promote Open source contribution.

The outline  of agenda planned by them is as follows.
- Introduction to Open source Contribution.
- Contributing to Webcompat
- Introduction to IoT
- Firefox [Test Pilot](http://mozillatn.github.io/blog/Firefox-test-pilot/) Install Fest

So as planned  the twitter handle of MozillaTN(([@MozillaTN](http://twitter.com/mozillaTN/)) is shared with them so that they can post the updates live. We also belive that this will reach a big mass if u support us.

Donâ€™t forget to follow our Twitter account to know more about what is happening in their event this saturday(17-09-2016).
